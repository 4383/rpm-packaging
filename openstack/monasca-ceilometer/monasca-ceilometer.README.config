Ceilometer aims to deliver a unique point of contact for billing systems to
acquire all counters they need to establish customer billing, across all
current and future OpenStack components. The delivery of counters must be
tracable and auditable, the counters must be easily extensible to support new
projects, and agents doing data collections should be independent of the
overall system.

Monasca Ceilometer (Ceilosca) is an add-on to Ceilometer which enables the
metering data to be stored in Monasca Datastore via publisher mechanism as
monasca metrics.
